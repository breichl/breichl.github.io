I'm an oceanographer at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory working to understand how the impacts of small-scale ocean processes, such as boundary layer turbulence and ocean surface gravity waves, can be represented in large scale ocean models, such as [MOM6](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6). As part of this work I use output from high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation process models to develop and improve vertical mixing parameterizations. This includes research to improve understanding of how surface waves increase boundary layer mixing due to Langmuir turbulence, which is an important factor for predicting accurate mixed layers in ocean climate models. I also work on model development, including implementing a coupled version of MOM6 with [WAVEWATCH III](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3), which is useful to understand how ocean surface waves impact air-sea interaction in weather and climate modeling (such as via Langmuir turbulence and enhanced air-sea fluxes).
